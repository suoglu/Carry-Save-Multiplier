# Carry Save Multiplier

This repository contain variety of carry save multipliers. 4 random test cases are selected for simulation. Simulation file is [testbench.v](https://github.com/suoglu/Carry-Save-Multiplier/blob/master/testbench.v). Testing will be done on [Digilent Basys 3](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/basys-3/reference-manual) FPGA.
